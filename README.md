# get-user-mbti

I was able to take a step forward in React through the Clone Coding class.

I learned the importance of JavaScript library and now I can apply it.

Also, I studied the type script that will be used in practice in the future.

The instructor explained the project to find his hero with MBTI.

It was produced slowly for 5 weeks using the above language and library.
